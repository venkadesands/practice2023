Advantages:
	Object creation get reduces
	memory usage is reduced
	reusable code purpose 
 
inheritance
	single inheritance
	multiple inheritance
	multilevel inheritance
	Hierarchical inheritance
	hybrid inheritance
	
single:
	one parent class to one child class
	parent class --> support to child
multiple inheritance
	more then one parent class accessed by one child class not possible in
	java class, overcome with interface
	
	
	
multi -level inheritance
	level by level inheritance
	
	grandparent-->parent-->child
one parent class accessed by one child class 
	- which one accessed by another one child class
	
	
polymorphism
	Task implement in many ways/Execting methods in  more then one form
	
	types
	-method overloading(compile time polymarpism/static binding/static polymophism/early binding)
	-method overriding(lateral binding)
